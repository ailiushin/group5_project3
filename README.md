# **Renewable Energy**

<br>

> ## Project Description
With population and economic growth, as well as greater and associated consumption patterns, it contributes to a steady growth in demand for at United States. The project objective is creating an interactive visualization to analyze renewable energy (solar, wind, geothermal, biopower, and hydro) production x the total of energy consumption across all the United States.

> ## Data Sources

• Consumption per capita per state - https://www.eia.gov/state/rankings/#/series/12

• United States Census - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population#cite_note-5

• https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/washimahmed/usa-latlong-for-state-abbreviations

<br>

>## Visualization
Using Leaflet was created an interactive map describing the energy excess capacity per state.
